# Introduction
Housing price prediction utilizes data-driven models to estimate property values based on factors like 
income, house characteristics, and location. It aids buyers and sellers in making informed decisions and 
guides real estate investments. Key challenges include non-linearity in market dynamics and data 
variability over time. Regression models, such as Linear Regression and Decision Trees, are commonly 
employed for this task. Accurate predictions contribute to a transparent and efficient real estate market, 
benefiting various stakeholders.

# Dataset Cleaning
In this step, the focus was on ensuring the dataset's completeness and addressing any missing values that 
might impact the subsequent analysis and modeling. The process involves the following steps:
1. Identification of Missing Values
2. Handling Missing Values
3. Significance of No Missing Values
4. Impact on Analysis
5. Preparation for Exploration

# Data Exploration
1. Statistical Overview:
Utilized df.describe() to generate basic statistical summaries (mean, standard deviation, min, max, 
quartiles) for each numeric column in the dataset. This provides insights into the central tendency and 
spread of the data.
2. Visual Exploration:
Correlation values close to 1 or -1 indicate strong positive or negative correlations, 
respectively. Employed scatter plots, such as 'MedInc' vs. 'target,' to identify patterns and relationships 
between specific features and the target variable.

# Feature Engineering
1. Creating a New Feature: 'RoomsPerHousehold': A new feature, 'RoomsPerHousehold,' is created by taking the ratio of 'AveRooms' to 'HouseAge.'
2. Handling Categorical Variables:
Handling categorical variables is a common aspect of feature engineering.In the above data, a hypothetical 
categorical variable 'categorical_column' is used as an illustration. One-hot encoding is applied to convert 
categorical variables into numerical format, creating binary columns for each category.

# Model Selection
Two regression models were chosen for experimentation: Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor. 
These models serve as initial candidates for predicting housing prices based on the dataset's features.
